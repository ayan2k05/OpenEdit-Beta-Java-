# OpenEdit(Java) - The Minimalist's Dream Text Editor  

**Because VS Code is a RAM-hungry monster and Notepad is too basic.** 

## What is OpenEdit?  
OpenEdit is a lightweight, no-nonsense text editor built with Java Swing. It‚Äôs like Notepad but with a few extra brain cells‚Äîand unlike VS Code, it won‚Äôt eat your RAM for breakfast. 
Syntax highlighting will be available soon, if my Girlfriend stops giving me headache.(Yes, I have One)
If you need a simple yet functional text editor that doesn‚Äôt judge you for your terrible code, OpenEdit-jav is here for you.

## Features (Things That Somehow Works)  

**Line Numbers** ‚Äì Because counting manually is hard. 
**Auto-Closing Brackets** ‚Äì Saves you from unclosed `(`, `{`, `[`, and `"` nightmares.
**Dark & Light Theme** ‚Äì Choose between hacker mode üï∂Ô∏è and grandma-friendly mode(Light theme is the reasons why your grandma is blind). 
**File Operations** ‚Äì Open, Save, and Create new files‚Äîjust like a real text editor! 
**Built-in Terminal Launcher** ‚Äì Open your system‚Äôs terminal right from the editor. 
**Resizable Text** ‚Äì Because your eyes deserve comfort.

## Installation (How to Make It Work)  

### Prerequisites  
- **Computer** - Recommended(It may come handy)
- **Java (JDK 8 or later)** ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt have it installed, your computer is basically a rock. 
- **A brain** ‚Äì Optional but recommended. 

### Running OpenEdit  
1. **Clone the repo** (or download it like a caveman): 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ayan2k05/OpenEdit-Beta-java-.git
   cd BetaEdit
   ```

2. **Compile the code**: 
   ```sh
   javac OpenEdit.java
   ```

3. **Run it**: 
   ```sh
   java OpenEdit
   ```

And kaa boom!!!! You now have your own lightweight text editor.

## Themes: Light vs. Dark Mode  

- Light Mode: Looks clean but may burn your retinas at 3 AM.(I have gone blind) 
- Dark Mode: For those who code in the shadows. 

Toggle between theme with the **"Toggle Theme"** button.

## Magic Inside the Code  

- **Line Numbering** ‚Äì A function that counts lines correctly. 
- **Auto-Braces** ‚Äì Because manually closing brackets is so 2005. 
- **Dynamic Font Size Adjustment** ‚Äì Zoom in and out.
- **Low budget python dev will love it** - Yeah i have added Indentation on TAB, so you low-budget, low-testosterone guys can code while arguing that how python have changed the whole universe. (Cry about it, I prefer java and C or maybe C++, if i really want to shoot myself in balls)

## Why Use OpenEdit?  
- Uses **fewer resources** than bloated IDEs(Featureless in the name of Minimalism). 
- Opens instantly‚Äîunlike some **Electron-based nightmares** (*cough* VS Code *cough*). 
- It's **open-source**, so you can tweak it, break it, or pretend you wrote it.
